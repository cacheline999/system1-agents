"""``BrowserDecisionModel``: a decision model in the browser subagent's model slot.

On a browser turn (the tool list contains ``browser_click``) it settles and probes the page through
the bound ``BrowserAgentRuntime``, asks the model (every head of the action space in one ``decide_many``,
re-asked once on an unusable answer), and returns exactly one ``browser_*`` tool call. Every other call
(summaries, value generation) goes to the wrapped chat model. Jev over HTTP and Laya in process fill the
model_name alike.
