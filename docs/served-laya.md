# Served Laya: a decision model over HTTP

## 1. Requirements

Functional (from #20):
- An agent can use a Laya model served by system1-omni instead of loading it in process, from the CLI
  and from MCP, with no cloud key; the in-process `--model laya` stays.
- `choice` and `noul`, one or several questions per request, through the existing answer validation.
- Runs record which model, checkpoint and serving backend answered.

Non-functional:
- Latency: a warm decision on MPS takes 25–160 ms server-side; the client adds little on localhost.
- Failure: a slow or absent server fails one decision within a bounded deadline, with a clear error.
- Contract: one written interface both repositories test against (OpenAPI 3.1, [api/laya-systemone.openapi.yaml](api/laya-systemone.openapi.yaml)).

Constraints: today's server is laya-serve 0.3.20 behind the system1-omni worker and optionally the Rust
frontend. The design sets the target interface; section 4 says where each part that is not there yet
gets built, and how the client works with both in the meantime.

## 2. High level

```
agent step ──► ServedLayaModel (s1a) ──HTTP──► [omni-jev frontend :8080] ──► Laya worker :8000 ──► laya (MPS/CPU)
                 │  laya_question()              forwards unchanged           warmup before listen
                 │  answer validation            502/504 if worker down       /health: device, revision, compile
                 └─ run record: identity (served_by) + client round trip
```

## 3. Interface (target; full spec in [api/laya-systemone.openapi.yaml](api/laya-systemone.openapi.yaml))

| | |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/systemone` | `{model?, state, questions}` → `{model, served_by, answers, usage, routing}` |
| `GET /livez`, `/readyz` | process up; ready to serve (503 + `Retry-After` until warm). `/health` stays as an alias |
| Errors | RFC 9457 `application/problem+json` with a stable `code`; 422 lists every invalid question |
| Tracing | `X-Request-Id` (or W3C `traceparent`) in, echoed out, used as problem `instance` |
| Timing | `Server-Timing: queue, infer` from the worker, `proxy` added by the frontend |
| Overload | bounded queue; 503 + `Retry-After` when full |
| Auth | optional bearer token; 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` |
| Limits | 1–64 questions, state ≤ 50,000 chars, body ≤ 2 MiB; advertised in `/readyz` |
| Evolution | additive within `/v1`; unknown request fields ignored; breaking change → `/v2`, `Deprecation`/`Sunset` |
| Semantics | deterministic and side-effect free: any request may be retried, no idempotency key |

## 4. From today to the target

Today's behaviour is specified in [api/laya-systemone.current.openapi.yaml](api/laya-systemone.current.openapi.yaml), checked against
traffic captured from a running worker. Validating that traffic against the target spec: every error response, the missing
`served_by`, and the absent `X-Request-Id` / `Server-Timing` headers are the gap; `/health` already
matches. Most of it sits in the worker, which wraps laya-serve's app, so laya itself needs no change.

| item | today | built in |
|---|---|---|
| problem+json errors with `code` | `{"detail"}` (worker), text/plain (frontend 502/504) | worker: exception handler over laya-serve's app; frontend: its two error bodies |
| 422 lists every invalid question | first invalid question only | worker: validate all questions before calling laya |
| `X-Request-Id`, `traceparent` | not handled | worker middleware; frontend forwards the headers (it already forwards the rest) |
| `Server-Timing` | none | worker middleware around the inference call; frontend appends `proxy` |
| `served_by`, `model` = checkpoint | `model` is always `laya-rl-agent` | worker: add from the loaded agent (it already reports these in `/health`) |
| `/livez`, `/readyz` | worker binds after warmup, `/health` only | worker: bind first, gate `/readyz` on warmup |
| 503 + `Retry-After` on overload | requests queue without bound | worker: bounded queue in front of laya-serve's single inference thread |
| 415 on non-JSON bodies | parsed regardless of Content-Type | worker middleware |
| limits in `/readyz`, and each model's `max_len` and `head_max_len` | not advertised; the client is told the window | worker |

Client compatibility during the change: branch on the status code, read `code` when the body is
problem+json and fall back to `detail`; read identity from `served_by` when present, else from the
`/health` snapshot taken at warm-up.

## 5. Client design (system1-agents)

- **Selection.** `--model laya-served`, a new name so run records say served Laya, not Jev or in-process Laya.
- **Configuration.** `LAYA_SERVED_URL` (required), `LAYA_SERVED_MODEL` (default `english`),
  `LAYA_SERVED_API_KEY` (optional), `LAYA_SERVED_TIMEOUT_S` (default 5, one deadline per decision,
  retries included), `LAYA_SERVED_MAX_LEN` (default 512, the served checkpoint's window per question, for
  the same full-window check as in-process Laya). The server takes the window from the checkpoint
  (`english` 512, `multilingual` 1024) and does not report it, so the client's value has to match it: a
  higher one lets a cut state through.
- **Request.** Questions serialised with the existing `laya_question()`, which keeps Laya's own `noul`
  shape (a plain-string instruction). `score` is not sent until an agent needs it.
- **Identity.** Each response's `served_by` goes into the run record. Until servers send it, the client
  reads `/health` at warm-up and again whenever its reading is older than 30 s, inside the decision's
  deadline and with at most half of it (the worker reports the
  live device, and laya moves a model to the CPU on a GPU out-of-memory error), records the reading's
  time as `read_at`, and each decision takes the entry for the model that answered
  (`models[routing.model]` on the system1-omni worker, else its top-level fields when they name the
  checkpoint in `routing.repo`). `compiled` is true only for a model on the GPU of a worker started with
  `--compile`, since the worker runs every model on the CPU uncompiled. Plain laya-serve reports no
  checkpoint or revision, and a checkpoint the worker loaded since the last reading is in the next one,
  so for those the record keeps the response's `routing.repo` and leaves revision and device unknown.
- **Servers.** The system1-omni worker is the recommended server; plain laya-serve works with reduced
  identity. On MPS the worker's fast setting is `--compile --weights fp16`.
  Both apply on the GPU only: on the CPU, including after a fallback, the worker runs Laya's fp32
  model uncompiled.
- **Errors → agent errors.**

  | outcome | handling |
  |---|---|
  | connection refused / reset | retry once within the deadline (worker may be starting or restarting) |
  | 502, 504 | retry once within the deadline |
  | 503 (overloaded or not ready) | wait `Retry-After` if it fits the deadline, then retry once |
  | 400, 413, 422 | fail at once: the request is wrong, a retry returns the same |
  | 401 | fail at once as a configuration error |
  | 500 | fail at once: the same request fails the same way |
  | deadline passed | fail with a timeout error naming the URL; the deadline bounds the whole request, also a body that keeps trickling in |

  A worker that loads another checkpoint while serving prepares it inside that request and holds every
  other request until it is ready, which takes longer than the default deadline. This client names its
  model in every request, so it causes such a load only when `LAYA_SERVED_MODEL` is not the model the
  worker started with; another client of the same worker can cause one too. Decisions fail with the timeout
  error meanwhile and answer again once the worker is ready; see "Run it" for how to load such a checkpoint
  ahead.

  laya-serve does not reject a `model` it does not know: it routes the request by the state's language.
  A mistyped `LAYA_SERVED_MODEL` would then be answered by whichever checkpoint suits each state, so the
  client fails with a configuration error when the response's `routing.reason` is not the explicit name.

- **Timing.** The record keeps the client round trip per decision and, when present, `Server-Timing`'s
  `queue` and `infer`, so network, queueing and model time separate. Today's servers send no
  `Server-Timing`, so `server_timing` is `{}` until the worker adds it.
- **Tracing.** The client sends an `X-Request-Id` per decision, the same on its retry, and stores it
  with the step.

## 6. Trade-offs

| decision | chosen | alternative | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| spec | hand-written OpenAPI 3.1 target, plus an as-implemented spec checked against captured traffic | generate from FastAPI | laya-serve reads the raw body, so FastAPI's generated schema has no request or response shape |
| errors | RFC 9457 with a stable `code` | keep `{"detail"}` | clients need a machine-readable reason; `detail` wording changes between laya versions |
| retries | client owns them; servers never retry | retries in the frontend | the client knows its step deadline; a retrying proxy multiplies load when the worker is saturated |
| identity | per-response `served_by` | only `/health` | a record then stays correct across worker restarts and multi-model routing |
| overload | 503 + `Retry-After` from a bounded queue | 429 | the limit is server capacity, not a per-client quota |
| readiness | `/livez` + `/readyz` | bind only after warmup (today) | a supervisor can tell a slow start from a dead process |
| timing | `Server-Timing` header | a field in the body | standard, visible in tooling, keeps the Jev-compatible body unchanged |
| model name | `laya-served` | reuse `laya` with a URL switch | in-process and served runs stay distinguishable in records and evaluations |

## 7. Revisit when

- Several agents share one worker: per-client quotas (429) on top of the capacity limit.
- Throughput matters more than single-request latency: batching concurrent requests in the worker.
- A second model family (ThinkFlowLab/system1-omni#9) reuses `/v1/systemone`: move `served_by` and the problem codes into a
  shared contract instead of the Laya spec.
- `score` becomes useful to an agent: extend the client; the server already answers it.

## 8. Run it

Start the server once, from a system1-omni checkout, with its
[Apple Silicon recipe](https://github.com/ThinkFlowLab/system1-omni/blob/main/recipe/laya/apple-silicon.md):

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m frontend.laya_mps --device mps --model english --require-device \
  --compile --weights fp16 --port 8000
```

The worker listens once it is warm, after about 40 s on an M1 Pro with these options; until then a
decision fails with "no served Laya at …", saying it may still be starting. On a Mac without MPS, or on Linux, drop `--compile`
and `--weights fp16` and use `--device cpu`. laya-serve's `LAYA_API_KEY` still turns on bearer auth; set the
same value in `LAYA_SERVED_API_KEY`. The Rust frontend (`omni-jev`, port 8080) can sit in
front of it; point `LAYA_SERVED_URL` at whichever you call.

Start the worker with the model in `LAYA_SERVED_MODEL`. Asked for another one, the worker loads and
prepares it inside that request, which outlasts the client's deadline: send the worker one request for
it after startup, as the recipe says, or raise `LAYA_SERVED_TIMEOUT_S` for the first one. For
`multilingual`, also set `LAYA_SERVED_MAX_LEN=1024`, its window.

Then, from this repository, with no extra installed:

```sh
export LAYA_SERVED_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
uv run s1a decide --model laya-served --state '{"ticket": "I was charged twice"}' \
  --option billing='a payment problem' --option technical='a product fault' --rules 'route the ticket'
uv run s1a run ticket_router --model laya-served --rethink off --seed 0 --episodes 1
```

Over MCP, the `decide` tool takes `model="laya-served"`. `s1a-mcp` reads `LAYA_SERVED_URL` from its own
environment: set it in the host's MCP server entry, or in `.env` at the repository root.

Each tool-front step records `source: laya-served`, `model` as `<checkpoint>@<revision>` and
`served_by` with the device, dtypes, whether the model was compiled and the time of the `/health` reading it
came from.
Against plain laya-serve, `served_by` has the checkpoint only.

In-process and served Laya routed all 90 ticket-router decisions the same on an M1 Pro; the numbers are in
[evals/ticket_router/SERVED_LAYA.md](../evals/ticket_router/SERVED_LAYA.md).
