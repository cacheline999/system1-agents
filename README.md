† The first Allrecipes task of the [WebVoyager](https://github.com/MinorJerry/WebVoyager) task set
([He et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13919), Apache-2.0, attribution in [NOTICE](NOTICE)): a vegetarian
lasagna with over 100 reviews, 4.5 stars or more, for 6. The chat model of that row is Claude Fable 5.1 through
OpenRouter; both models pay it for the typed search text and the answer. \* Estimated; the chat-model run recorded no
cost. Each replay below is the episode behind its row, Jev on the left and the chat model on the right, both on the
wall clock. The other Allrecipes runs, longer games and the Google Flights driver comparison with its rerun of
2026-09-23: [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md).

## Choose your path

### From Claude Code or Codex

```bash
npx skills add ThinkFlowLab/system1-agents                                                              # the skill: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor
claude plugin marketplace add ThinkFlowLab/system1-agents && claude plugin install s1a@system1-agents   # plus the browser subagent and the MCP server
```

The skill tells the host when to hand a task to a System 1 agent and which command to run. The ticket router from
the table above, from Claude Code:

> Route this ticket to logistics, payment, returns, account or human: "I was charged twice for order 4411 and I
> want the second charge refunded."

The host runs one `s1a decide` over the five queues and reports the queue with its probability, in about 400 ms.
Page tasks, games and one-off selections go the same way; arithmetic, deduction and free text stay with the chat
model. The walkthrough, the plugin's keys and what to delegate: [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md).

### From the command line

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThinkFlowLab/system1-agents && cd system1-agents
uv sync && cp .env.example .env     # the first sync resolves the openjiuwen pin and takes a few minutes
```

Put a Jev key in `.env` (`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` from the [TypeSafe console](https://console.typesafe.ai), or
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`), then ask for one decision and run one agent with each model:

```bash
uv run s1a decide --state '{"player_total": 18, "dealer_upcard": 9}' \
  --option hit="take a card" --option stand="keep the hand" --rules "stand on 17 or more"
uv sync --extra blackjack
uv run s1a run blackjack --model jev --rethink off --episodes 20
uv run s1a run blackjack --model llm --rethink off --episodes 20     # the chat model in the same agent
```

`decide` prints one JSON object with `choice`, a probability per option, `confidence` and `ms`; `run` writes a job
folder with the score. Without a key, `--model cua` answers in process after `uv sync --extra cua`.

### As an MCP server

```bash
codex mcp add s1a -- uv run --project /path/to/system1-agents s1a-mcp
```

It serves three tools, `list_agents`, `run_agent` and `decide`, to any host that speaks MCP.

## Build your own

A System 1 agent is one module under `s1a/agents/` that ends in a frozen `SPEC`; Blackjack is 111 lines. The builder
skill runs in Claude Code from this checkout, probes the task with 8 to 12 hand-written decisions before it writes
code, and stops when the task needs deduction or arithmetic:

> Build a System 1 agent for <task>.

The gates and the templates: [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md#build-a-system-1-agent).

## What ships

- `allrecipes`: browser use, [WebVoyager](https://github.com/MinorJerry/WebVoyager)'s first Allrecipes task, headed on the live site.
- `flights`: browser use, a Google Flights search over `@playwright/mcp`.
- `desktop`: computer use, any Windows or macOS app window through [Cua Driver](https://cua.ai/docs/cua-driver).
- `ticket_router`: 30 labelled support tickets to five queues.
- `alfworld`: household tasks in text, with the AI2-THOR scene in the replays.
- `game2048`, `millionaire`, `blackjack`: games with a score per episode.
- `injection_guard`: a rail that answers one question at a hook of a running agent and fails closed.

These use cases are [application candidates](CONTRIBUTING.md#application-candidates) for the required
application + System1-Agents + System1-Omni video in important PRs.

Every agent runs on `jev`, `laya` or `cua`, and on the chat model for the comparison. Flags, run commands and
extras: [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md).

## How it works

Each agent is a stock [openJiuwen](https://github.com/openJiuwen-ai/agent-core) agent with a System 1 decision
model as its `model`. On a decision turn the model gets the state and the options and answers with one of them;
planning, typed values and the final answer stay with the chat model in the same agent. Any decision model with that
interface fits: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md), [docs/decision-models.md](docs/decision-models.md).
