# Ticket router: in-process Laya against served Laya

Date: 2026-10-03, on the merged worker; first run on 2026-10-01. The plan below was fixed before the runs.

## Setup

| | how | Laya |
|---|---|---|
| C-in | `--model laya`, `LAYA_DEVICE=mps` | in process: fp32 weights, not compiled |
| C-direct | `--model laya-served`, `LAYA_SERVED_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000` | system1-omni worker, `--compile --weights fp16`, MPS |
| C-front | `--model laya-served`, `LAYA_SERVED_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080` | the same worker process behind `omni-jev` |

- Checkpoint `convaiinnovations/laya` at `55cf4c4`, laya 0.3.20, torch 2.14.0.
- C-in ran with laya 0.3.20 installed over the locked version (`uv pip install 'laya==0.3.20'`), so both sides ran the library the worker pins.
- Hardware: M1 Pro (16 GB), macOS 26.1, on AC power.
- system1-omni at `58b8cbe`, the merge of ThinkFlowLab/system1-omni#30; `omni-jev` built from the same commit.
- system1-agents on branch `served-laya`, the commit that last changed the results below.
- Each configuration ran `s1a run ticket_router --model <m> --rethink off --seed 0 --episodes 3`. Seeds 0, 1 and 2 shuffle the same 30 tickets, giving 90 decisions per configuration.
- Order: the worker started once and was ready after 39 s. C-direct and C-front ran against it. The worker was then stopped and C-in ran, so no two models shared the GPU.
- The one-minute load average was 5.2–6.4 at the start of each configuration, from other work on the machine.

## Results

| config | correct | p50 ms | p95 ms | episodes s | model recorded | served on |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| C-in | 63/90 | 96 | 109 | 9.9 | `laya-rl-agent` | in process |
| C-direct | 63/90 | 75 | 92 | 8.4 | `convaiinnovations/laya@55cf4c4ebb4e` | mps, float16, compiled |
| C-front | 63/90 | 75 | 82 | 7.5 | `convaiinnovations/laya@55cf4c4ebb4e` | mps, float16, compiled, via `omni-jev` |

- Latency is per decision: the client round trip for the served configurations, the forward pass on a thread for C-in.
- Episode time is the sum over the three episodes. It leaves out process start and model load.

Routing agreement:
- All three configurations routed every one of the 90 (seed, ticket) pairs the same.
- C-in and C-direct differed by at most 0.001 in any probability.
- C-direct and C-front gave identical probabilities.
- The closest call in C-in had 0.0126 between its top two queues.

Both plan expectations held:
- C-direct and C-front agree everywhere.
- No ticket flips between the fp32 in-process model and the fp16 worker, so there are no differences to list.

C-in's lower speed comes from how Laya ran, fp32 and not compiled, against the worker's compiled fp16 model. It says nothing about HTTP cost. Direct and through the frontend had the same p50, 75 ms.

In-process runs record `laya-rl-agent`, the name laya reports. Served runs record the checkpoint and revision, plus `served_by` (device, dtypes, whether it was compiled, time of the `/health` reading) in every tick.

## Reproduce

Start the worker and the frontend as in [docs/served-laya.md](../../docs/served-laya.md#8-run-it). Then, from this repository:

```sh
LAYA_SERVED_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 uv run s1a run ticket_router --model laya-served --rethink off --seed 0 --episodes 3
LAYA_SERVED_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 uv run s1a run ticket_router --model laya-served --rethink off --seed 0 --episodes 3
# stop the worker, then, with laya 0.3.20 installed (uv pip install 'laya==0.3.20'; --no-sync keeps it)
LAYA_DEVICE=mps uv run --no-sync s1a run ticket_router --model laya --rethink off --seed 0 --episodes 3
uv run python evals/ticket_router/compare_served.py C-in=<job dir> C-direct=<job dir> C-front=<job dir> \
  --json evals/ticket_router/served_laya_records.json
```

Job directories stay local, as for the other results here. [served_laya_records.json](served_laya_records.json) keeps every decision of the three runs: ticket, expected and predicted queue, probabilities, ms and the recorded model.
