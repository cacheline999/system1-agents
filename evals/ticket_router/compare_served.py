"""Compare ticket-router jobs that ran the same seeds with different decision models (in-process vs served Laya).

    uv run python evals/ticket_router/compare_served.py C-in=<job dir> C-direct=<job dir> C-front=<job dir> \
        [--json records.json]

Prints one markdown table (correct routes, per-decision latency p50/p95, total episode time, the answering model and
where it ran), how many (seed, ticket) pairs each two configurations routed the same, and every pair routed
differently with each configuration's top two probabilities. A job dir is what ``s1a run ticket_router`` prints as
``job_dir``; episode time excludes process start and model load. ``--json`` also writes every decision (seed,
ticket, expected and predicted queue, probabilities, ms, model, served_by) per configuration, since job dirs stay local.
